Rule Engine with AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

This project implements a 3-tier rule engine application that determines user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, and more. It allows the dynamic creation, combination, and modification of rules represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Features

	•	Dynamic Rule Creation: Create rules that can be modified dynamically.
	•	AST Representation: Use AST to represent conditional rules.
	•	Combine Rules: Combine multiple rules into a single AST.
	•	Evaluate Rules: Evaluate the rules against user-provided data.
	•	Persistence with MySQL: Store and manage rules in a MySQL database.
	•	Error Handling: Handles invalid rule formats and data inputs.
